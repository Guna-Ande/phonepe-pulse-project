Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization Project


Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a vast amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The aim of this project is to extract, process, and visualize this data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The solution involves steps like data extraction, transformation, database integration, and creating a live geo visualization dashboard.

Approach:
Data Extraction: Clone the Github repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format.

Data Transformation: Utilize Python scripting along with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing to prepare it for analysis.

Database Insertion: Connect to a MySQL database using "mysql-connector-python" library to insert the transformed data efficiently.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python. Plotly's geo mapping functions will be utilized for visualization. Streamlit will create a user-friendly interface with dropdown options for users.

Data Retrieval: Connect to the MySQL database to fetch data into a Pandas dataframe for dynamic updates on the dashboard.

Deployment: Ensure security, efficiency, and user-friendliness. Thoroughly test the solution and deploy the dashboard publicly for easy access.

Results:
The outcome of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard presenting insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository. It will feature a minimum of 10 dropdown options for users to select various facts and figures for display. Data will be stored in MySQL for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will dynamically reflect the latest data.

Users can access the dashboard from a web browser, navigating through different visualizations and facts easily. It will provide valuable insights, aiding data analysis and decision-making processes. Overall, this project offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for data extraction, transformation, and visualization from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
